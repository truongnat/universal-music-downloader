### 1. Project Analysis

#### Strengths

*   **Solid Foundation:** The project is built on a modern and robust tech stack, including Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This provides a solid foundation for future development and scalability.
*   **Clear and Intuitive UI:** The user interface is clean, simple, and easy to use. The tab-based navigation makes it easy for users to switch between different download options.
